*   Check your [environment-variables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable): _JAVA_HOME_ needs to point to the root-directory of your JDK.

## 2) Install

About
-----

Jease eases the development of content- & database-driven web-applications with Java.
Out of the box Jease provides an Ajax-powered Content-Management-System (CMS) which makes use of drag & drop to organize content.
* A relational database that holds blog posts and users.


This project is just meant to be a demonstration, therefore it is neither well documented nor well tested. Use it to learn about the technologies used, but do not use it for productive applications.

Any feedback is welcome, and I will incorporate useful pull requests.

Technologies
------------

* [DB4O](http://db4o.com) db4o or Perst or ZooDB as object-oriented persistence engines
* [Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/) Lucene as high performance indexing and search technology.
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [ZK](https://zkoss.org/) ZK as component- & event-driven Ajax-Web-Framework.
* [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) Apache  Solr is the popular, blazing-fast, open source enterprise search platform built on Apache Luceneâ„¢. 


Running
-------

Make sure [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) >= 2.2.1 is installed on your system. Go into the project dir and type `mvn clean package`, then deploy war file generated in target folder on a java webserver like tomcat and then point your browser to `http://localhost:8080`.
